# nucleo-stm32f413
Nucleo STM32F413 board example &amp; test

This repository contains some code for the board. The repo will contain different examples to compile & run in the board.

Load the project in STM32CubeIDE and compile it!

_Note_

As I have found difficult to start coding using test editor and compiler, first I am using STM32CudeIDE for getting used to all the Cortex-M/STM32 software development process.
My ultimate goal is to get rid off this tool and to use Test Editor + Cmake/Make + gdb + OpenOCD/STLink.
